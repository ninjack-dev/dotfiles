## To-Do
- Kitty `panel`s
    - [ ] Update Kitty `panel` invocations to use a headless, already-running instance, if possible, to decrease startup time.
    - [x] Add layer/animation rules to see if the "lag" with moving windows/the Astal panel, if possible
- Write scripts for:
    - [ ] screenshots
    - [ ] screen recording
        - It may be nice to bundle these two into a widget a la HyprPanel's
- [ ] Set up Hyprlock (and perhaps Greetd, or something similar)
- [ ] Add descriptions to all `bindd`s
- [ ] Determine mod mask for keybind searcher later
